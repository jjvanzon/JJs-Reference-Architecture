Tech Test / Short Code Review Checklist
---------------------------------------

- Functional:
    - Read the work item text, including parent work items.
    - What does the requested functionality mean?
    - Test functionally, litterly as interpreted by the programmer
    - Is the scope interpreted right? Is everything changed that needed to be changed?
- Technical:
    - Where in the code is it?
    - Is the data stored?
    - Is the code OK?
    - Look at the code base commits.
    - Do not worry too much about minor issues. (Unless it is really unhandy. You win more by keeping the code the way a programmer wrote it.)
