### ***Tech Test / Short Code Review Checklist***
- Functional:
  - Read the work item text, including parent work items.
  - What does the requested functionality mean?
  - Test functionally, litterly as interpreted by the programmer
  - Is the scope interpreted right? Is everything changed that needed to be changed?
- Technical:
  - Where in the code is it?
  - Is the data stored?
  - Is the code OK?
  - Look at the code base commits.
  - Do not worry too much about minor issues. (Unless it is really unhandy. You win more by keeping the code the way a programmer wrote it.)
